# QuantEcon WASM Lectures

[![Build Status](https://github.com/QuantEcon/lecture-wasm/workflows/Build%20and%20Deploy%20to%20GitHub%20Pages/badge.svg)](https://github.com/QuantEcon/lecture-wasm/actions)

A browser-based version of [A First Course in Quantitative Economics with Python](https://intro.quantecon.org/intro.html) powered by Pyodide and JupyterLite.

## Overview

This repository contains a WASM-compatible subset of the QuantEcon lecture series. Using Pyodide kernel and JupyterLite, these lectures run entirely in your browser without requiring any local Python installation.

**Key Features:**
- üåê **Browser-based execution** - No installation required
- üöÄ **Powered by Pyodide** - Full Python environment in WebAssembly
- üìö **Interactive learning** - Execute code cells directly in the browser
- üîÑ **Synchronized content** - Maintained in sync with the main lecture repository

## Getting Started

### View the Lectures

Visit the live site: [QuantEcon WASM Lectures](https://quantecon.github.io/lecture-wasm/)

### Local Development

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js 18.x or higher

#### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/QuantEcon/lecture-wasm.git
   cd lecture-wasm
   ```

2. Install Node.js dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install -g mystmd thebe-core thebe thebe-lite
   ```

   **Note:** Python dependencies in `requirements.txt` are legacy from the old build system and not required for `mystmd` builds.

#### Build and Serve

Build the lecture series:
```bash
cd lectures
myst build --html
```

Start the local development server:
```bash
cd lectures
myst start
```

The lectures will be available at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

To stop the server, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

## Content Management

### Updating Lectures

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Do not edit lectures directly in this repository!

To update lecture content:

1. Make your changes in the [wasm branch of lecture-python-intro](https://github.com/QuantEcon/lecture-python-intro/tree/wasm)
2. Run the synchronization script in this repository:
   ```bash
   python update_lectures.py
   ```

This workflow ensures all lectures stay synchronized with the main repository and maintains WASM compatibility.

### What the Sync Script Does

The `update_lectures.py` script:
- Downloads the latest content from the `wasm` branch
- Copies lecture files to the `lectures/` directory  
- Converts `!pip install` to `%pip install` for WASM compatibility
- Removes `--upgrade` flags from pip commands
- Fixes MyST directive syntax for solutions and exercises
- Cleans up temporary files

### WASM-Unsupported Lectures

The following lectures are excluded due to WASM/Pyodide limitations:

- `business_cycle` - Requires packages not available in Pyodide
- `inequality` - Complex data processing dependencies
- `prob_dist` - Statistical packages with C extensions
- `heavy_tails` - Advanced statistical libraries
- `commod_price` - Financial data dependencies
- `lp_intro` - Linear programming solvers
- `short_path` - Graph algorithms requiring native code
- `input_output` - Matrix computation dependencies

## Technology Stack

- **[MyST Markdown](https://mystmd.org/)** - Markdown flavor for technical documentation and build system
- **[JupyterLite](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/)** - Browser-based Jupyter environment
- **[Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/)** - Python runtime in WebAssembly
- **[Thebe](https://thebe.readthedocs.io/)** - Executable code cells
- **GitHub Actions** - Automated builds and deployment
- **Netlify** - PR preview deployments

## CI/CD Pipeline

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment:

### On Push to `main`
- Builds MyST HTML with GitHub Pages base URL
- Deploys to GitHub Pages at https://quantecon.github.io/lecture-wasm/

### On Pull Requests  
- Builds preview version
- Deploys to Netlify with PR-specific URL
- Posts preview link as PR comment

### Build Process
- Uses Node.js 18.x
- Installs MyST CLI and Thebe dependencies
- Builds from `lectures/` directory
- Outputs to `lectures/_build/html/`
